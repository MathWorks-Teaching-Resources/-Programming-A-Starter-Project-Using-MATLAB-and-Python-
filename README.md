**Curriculum Module**

_Created with R2024a. Compatible with R2024a and later releases._

# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach fundamental concepts and basic terminology related to programming computers. 

# Prerequisite Domain Knowledge

This module assumes familiarity with basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, and functions, structures including arrays and structs, and control flows including if/else as well as how to use them in MATLAB. These ideas are all presented with interactive examples in [<u>Fundamentals of Programming</u>](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/103225-fundamentals-of-programming), [<u>Programming: Organizing Data</u>](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/115900-programming-organizing-data), [<u>Programming: Structuring Code</u>](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/115905-programming-structuring-code).


## Background

You can use these live scripts as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. This module explores interactions between systems by using the OpenWeather API and calling into Python from MATLAB. **Programming: A Starter Project Using MATLAB with Python** covers using the Run Python Code Live Task to run provided Python code, accessing the OpenWeather API to check the weather, extracting useful data from the API call, and using App Designer to create an app with a personalized weather display.


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/EndIcon.png" width="19" alt="EndIcon.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Prerequisites

This module assumes familiarity with basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, and functions, structures including arrays and structs, and control flows including if/else as well as how to use them in MATLAB. These ideas are all presented with interactive examples in [<u>Fundamentals of Programming</u>](https://github.com/MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Fundamentals-of-Programming), [<u>Programming: Organizing Data</u>](https://github.com/MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Programming-Organizing-Data), [<u>Programming: Structuring Code</u>](https://github.com/MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Programming-Structuring-Code).


## Getting Started
### Accessing the Module
### **On MATLAB Online:**

Use the [<img src="Images/OpenInMO.png" width="136" alt="OpenInMO.png">](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Programming-A-Starter-Project-Using-MATLAB-and-Python&project=MATLABwithPython.prj) link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see an app with several navigation options to get you started.

### **On Desktop:**

Download or clone this repository. Open MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing these scripts and double\-click on [MATLABwithPython.prj](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Programming-A-Starter-Project-Using-MATLAB-and-Python&project=MATLABwithPython.prj&file=README.mlx). It will add the appropriate files to your MATLAB path and open an app that asks you where you would like to start. 


Ensure you have all the required products (listed below) installed. If you need to include a product, add it using the Add\-On Explorer. To install an add\-on, go to the **Home** tab and select  <img src="Images/AddOnsIcon.png" width="16" alt="AddOnsIcon.png"> **Add-Ons** > **Get Add-Ons**. 


## Products

MATLAB® is used throughout. Tools from the Symbolic Math Toolbox™ are used to convert between different unit systems in the weather applications.

# Apps

Both of these apps require running Python from MATLAB, as set up in UsingMATLABwithPython and an OpenWeather API key, as set up in CheckingTheWeather.

-  **<samp>CurrentWeatherAppDemo.mlapp</samp>** shows the results of working through CreateCurrentWeatherApp.  
-  **<samp>WeatherDisplay.mlapp</samp>** shows one elaborated version of the basic current weather app.
